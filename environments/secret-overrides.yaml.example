# Secret overrides — use this file to provide explicit credentials
# instead of seed-derived secrets. Useful when connecting to external
# infrastructure (managed databases, cloud S3, etc.).
#
# Copy to <env-name>.secret-overrides.yaml and uncomment needed values.
# Add the file to your helmfile environment values list.
#
# All keys are optional. Omitted keys fall back to seed derivation.
